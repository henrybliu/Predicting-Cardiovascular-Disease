# Machine Learning - Predicting Cardiovascular Disease
This project aims to analyze a dataset of 70,000 surveyed patients to identify correlations and predictors of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). By conducting data cleaning and analysis, we aim to uncover significant factors that influence the likelihood of having CVD. Specifically, our findings indicate that systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, and weight are the most significant indicators of susceptibility to CVD.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of 70,000 patient records collected through surveys. Each record contains various attributes related to the patients' health, including blood pressure readings, cholesterol levels, age, weight, and the presence or absence of CVD. The dataset has been preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies or missing values to ensure accurate analysis.

# Goals
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Identify correlations: We aim to explore the relationships between different attributes and the presence of CVD. By analyzing the dataset, we can identify correlations that may provide insights into the underlying factors contributing to CVD.

Predictive modeling: Utilizing the dataset, we intend to develop predictive models that can estimate the likelihood of an individual having CVD based on various attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, and weight. These models will aid in early detection and prevention efforts.

Feature importance: By analyzing the dataset and employing statistical techniques, we seek to determine the most significant factors that contribute to the development of CVD. Understanding these factors can help healthcare professionals prioritize interventions and develop targeted prevention strategies.

# Analysis Process
The analysis process comprises the following steps:

Data cleaning: We thoroughly cleaned the dataset by removing any missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and addressing outliers. This step ensures the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.

Exploratory data analysis: We conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to gain insights into the distributions of various attributes and their relationships with the presence or absence of CVD. This helped us identify potential correlations and patterns.

Statistical analysis: Using appropriate statistical techniques such as correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression models, we examined the relationships between different attributes and CVD. This allowed us to determine the significance of each attribute and identify predictors of CVD.

Model development: We developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines. These models were trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to ensure their accuracy and reliability.

Interpretation and visualization: We presented our findings through clear and interpretable visualizations, including charts, graphs, and tables. These visual aids help communicate the relationships and patterns we discovered in the dataset.

# In Progress
We are currently working on enhancing our project by incorporating additional features and developing an interactive interface for improved analysis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

## Additional ML Models
We aim to evaluate several commonly used machine learning models for predicting heart diseases to determine which model achieves the highest accuracy. The selected model will be utilized in our interactive interface to provide accurate predictions.

## Interactive Interface
To provide a user-friendly experience and enable personalized risk assessment, we are working on creating an interactive interface. This interface will allow users to input their characteristics, including relevant health attributes, and obtain an estimated diagnosis of their likelihood of having cardiovascular disease. By integrating the developed models, the interface will provide valuable insights and assist users in understanding their CVD risk profile.
